# Bank-Transaction-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project performs an in-depth EDA on a dataset of bank transactions, aiming to uncover insights about transaction patterns, customer demographics, and financial behaviors. Through data preprocessing, normalization, and a variety of visualizations, the project demonstrates key analytical techniques useful for understanding financial data

This mini-project covers:
Data Preprocessing: Discretization, normalization, and encoding of categorical features.
Data Visualization: Analysis of transaction patterns with pie charts, box plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, and 3D scatter plots to better understand relationships within the data.
Similarity Calculations: Identifying similarities within the dataset for deeper insights.
